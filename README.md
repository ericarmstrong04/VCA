# VCA
All the work I completed during my short time at VISA.

# Overview
Over the course of 2 weeks (and maybe more to come!), I shadowed a forecasting project within Visa's Consulting and Analytics Data Science department. I did my best to absorb as much information as I could, while also honing my own skills for the future. Down below, is a large jumble of code from my time there. Some of it may have errors or be incomplete since I was in practice for a very short duration, but most of the code should be complete.
