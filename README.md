# VCA
All the work I completed during my short time at VISA.

# Overview
I shadowed a forecasting project within Visa's Consulting and Analytics Data Science department. I did my best to absorb as much information as I could, while also honing my own skills for the future. Down below, is a large jumble of code from my time there. Some of it may have errors or be incomplete since I was in practice for a very short duration, but most of the code should be complete.

My main project responsibility for VISA was creating a regression model and time series forecasts which considered egg prices and their consumption rates, in order to better understand the general public's consumption patterns, and how extreme events like the bird flu or Trump's tariffs would impact them.
